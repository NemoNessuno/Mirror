# Mirror
During the summer course ``IXD S16 - On the Internet of things'' the students of the computer science department of the ``Freie Universit‰t Berlin'' and the product design students of the ''Kunsthochschule Weiﬂensee'' collaborated to create projects which envisioned the new possibilities the new generation of small ubiquitous computing devices provided. One of those projects is ``Mirror'' a device - or rather a set of devices - which aims to add a new layer of experience when two or more people move together. The name already indicates the basic idea of ``Mirror''. One person moves and another receives tactile feedback in order to mirror the first person. 

## How does it work
The basic principle is quite simple. The device contains multiple sensors to detect its current acceleration and rotation. This data is then transmitted  to the other participant(s). Depending on which data shall be used (see section \ref{sec:variations}) it might be neccessary to do some processing beforehand. The other participant's devices then instrumentalizes vibration motors to translate the received data into patterns that represent the transferred motion. After rather short discussion we agreed on concentrating our efforts to transfer the motion of the arms (or rather one arm). This helped us narrow our focus and we think that almost every movement of the bodies is reflected in the motions of the arm.
